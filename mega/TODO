- warp in effect ... make stars zoom or flash?

- we make an octo in the map, how do we know whether to wake as a mega-octo?

  mega-ness must be set by add_monster, so all octos are the same, but are made
  mega on wake if the world says so

  monsters are going to change colour when they wake, sigh

- veg could increase drag

- need to limit present spawning somehow

  make presents kill themselves after 300 frames?

- more world gen params

  map draw palette

  monster draw pallette, health goes up

- tune monster behaviours

- reread code, fix stuff

- crabs walk around edges and wake other monsters

  crabs are very light sleepers

- powerups in treasure chests

	* see monsters on scanner

	* higher top speed

	* see whole map on scanner

	* faster shield recovery

	* booby trap (releases monsters)
