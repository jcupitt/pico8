- reread code, minimise more

- level needs to be property of monster, not mt

  we can have a level with level 3 octos, but level 1 spawners

  the spawner will make level 1 octos, but we don't want to set .level in mt,
  or that'll stop our l3 octos 

- seeing some tile errors on mushrooms

- enter portal, it vanishes, world continues for 60 frames, then black

- veg could increase drag

- crabs walk around edges and wake other monsters

  crabs are very light sleepers

- powerups in treasure chests

	* see monsters on scanner

	* higher top speed

	* see whole map on scanner

	* faster shield recovery

	* booby trap (releases monsters)
